# 3D-engine

After fiddling with my 2D-engine thing (also on my github) I made this. It's a simple 3D-engine using ray casting to render its environment, 
which is super slow but at the same time gives the artifacts a soft light depth as if there is a torch on top of the camera illuminating the
scene. It's possible to move and rotate freely through the environment but there is no collision detection or anything similar.
